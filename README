This is GPar2 0.1, *alpha* release.

GPar2 aims at integrating every functionnality of par2cmdline in a GTK+ GUI. It depends on libpar2, libsigc++ and libgtkmm.

The engine should be working, since the lib is entirely based on par2cmdline. The current GUI is simplistic, allowing repairing a set with minimum feedback.

Please report any problems to the SourceForge BugTracker. Some autotools related problems are expected ;).
