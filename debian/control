Description: A GUI for verifying and repairing PAR and PAR2 recovery sets
 A simple, easy to use graphical interface for verification and
 repairation of PAR v1.0 and PAR v2.0(PAR2) recovery sets.  PAR1
 support is currently minimal, as it is deprecated this most
 likely will not change, so do not expect the headers, progress,
 output, and status to update when performing actions on these.
 GPar2 is based on GTKMM, a wrapper for GTK+, and requires the
 standard par2 library, libpar2, to run.
